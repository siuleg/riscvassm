        # Put your program into this file
        #
        # The "program" is a function that takes
        # no arguments and that does not return
        # anything.
        #
        # The program function does not need to
        # return. It may be a forever loop.
        # If the program function returns,
        # it gets called again (and again and again-again).
        #
        # Do not change the attributes of the
        # program function below.
        #
        # You may "declare" other functions
        # using the pattern stubbed out for
        # you below.
        #
        # You need to follow the ESP Risc-V ABI:
        #
        # * The Stack Pointer is in register sp.
        #   Every function needs to move the stack
        #   pointer up (to lower addresses) in the
        #   beginning of the function and move it
        #   down in the end. The move needs to make
        #   room for all temporary variables the function
        #   needs. The stack pointer may only be moved
        #   in multiples of 32 bytes for alignment purposes.
        #
        # * The return address is put into register
        #   ra by the branch-and-link instruction call.
        #   The callee function needs to start by storing
        #   the return address on the stack and end by
        #   restoring the return address from the stack.
        #   The place needed to store the return address
        #   on the stack needs to be accounted for
        #   when moving the stack pointer.
        #
        # * A function returns by executing a relative jump
        #   instruction jr on the return address:
        #
        #   jr          ra
        #
        #   This can be abbreviated to
        #
        #   ret
        #
        #   but the abbreviation is less understandable.
        #
        # * In addition to the stack pointer, every function
        #   needs to maintain the frame pointer. The frame pointer
        #   sits in register s0. It is equal to the stack pointer
        #   of the calling function. See below for an example on
        #   how to maintain the frame pointer. The frame pointer
        #   gets saved on the stack, then set to the stack pointer
        #   of the calling function and finally retrieved from
        #   the stack again. The place needed to store the
        #   frame pointer needs to be accounted for when moving the
        #   stack pointer.
        #
        # * When calling a function, the first arguments of the
        #   function are passed in registers a0 through a7. All
        #   other arguments are passed on the stack. That latter
        #   case is rare. Each register is 32 bit wide. 64 bit
        #   values are passed in even-odd register pairs. The even
        #   register contains the least significant bits (as Risc-V
        #   is little endian).
        #
        # * The value returned by a function is passed in register
        #   a0 when it is up to 32 bit wide. 64 bit return values
        #   use the even-odd register pair a0-a1.
        #
        # * Register x0 always contains the value 0.
        #
        # * A callee function can use the registers a0 through a7
        #   as temporaries, after having saved them on the stack
        #   if they are arguments that are still needed. None of
        #   the registers a0 through a7 are callee-saved though. This
        #   means a caller function cannot assume to find the
        #   same contents in these registers once a function it
        #   called returns.
        #
        # * A callee function can also use the temporary registers
        #   t0 through t6. They are caller-saved as well. This means
        #   that the calling function cannot assume to find
        #   the same contents in these registers once a function
        #   it called returns.
        #
        # * Students should not use the registers gp, tp, s0 (the
        #   frame pointer, other than saving it and restoring it),
        #   s1 and s2 through s11.
        #
        # * Besides register x0, which always contains the value 0,
        #   students should not use any register with name x<n>, like
        #   x1, x17 etc.
        #
        # * Not all Risc-V processors have floating-point units and
        #   floating-point instructions. Students should not use
        #   any floating-point registers and floating-point instructions.
        #
        # * Not all Risc-V processors have multiplication and division
        #   units. Students should not use any multiplication or
        #   division instructions.
        #
        # The following functions can be called for (very basic)
        # input and output on the UART simulated over USB:
        #
        # * The function
        #
        #   unsigned char get_character();
        #
        #   takes no arguments and returns one byte containing
        #   an ASCII character typed in by the user.
        #
        #   The function returns the byte in register a0, which
        #   is a 32 bit register. Only the 8 least significant
        #   bits of that byte are meaningful. The upper 24 bits
        #   can contain any value.
        #
        #   The function can be called with
        #
        #   call        get_character
        #
        # * The function
        #
        #   void put_character(unsigned char);
        #
        #   takes one byte in argument and returns nothing.
        #   It outputs the byte as an ASCII character on the screen.
        #
        #   The argument of the function is passed to put_character()
        #   in the lower 8 bits of register a0. The upper 24 bits of
        #   register a0 must be zero.
        #
        # * The two functions get_character() and put_character()
        #   of course abide by the ABI described above.
        #
        # The ESP32-C3 has no full operating system. Only one program
        # can run at the time. Nothing can be typed in or output if
        # a program does not call get_character() or put_character()
        # sufficiently often. On a full-grown computer with a real
        # operating system, this is different: the operating system can
        # still get user input and refresh the screen with output
        # while a program is computing.
        #
        # In order to avoid any issue with programs that get "stuck"
        # (in a long computation or just a buggy forever loop), the ESP32
        # hardware implements a watch-dog. This is special hardware that
        # reboots the microcontroller if none of the two functions
        # get_character() and put_character() has been called for 8 seconds.
        #
        # Students are advised to check for loops that run for too long
        # when they see their device rebooting without a warning.
        #
        # All address computations for the code segment are done by the
        # assembler. When writing assembly, we only use symbolic constants,
        # defined as labels.
        #
        # Any number of labels can be used in the program, but all labels
        # need to be unique in the assembly file. It is customary to
        # name labels functionname_l1, functionname_l2 and so on.
        #
        #
        # The following Assembly (pseudo-) instructions are available on
        # Risc-V.
        #
        # In this list, the [m:n] notation is used, for example for [31:12].
        # This notation means: take the (m-n+1) bits numbered m through n, both sides
        # included. For example, [31:12] means: take the 20 bits numbered 31 through 12.
        #
        # In a 32 bit word, the least significant bit has number 0, the most significant
        # bit has number 31.
        #
        # In the list below, M stands for memory.
        #
        # The case of the instructions is not important. On Linux, lower-case instructions
        # are mostly used.
        #
        # For load and store operations, instead of writing for example
        #
        #  SW   sp,ra,28
        #
        # the mnemonic
        #
        #  SW   ra,28(sp)
        #
        #  is mostly used. It means: store ra to the address in the stack pointer, offset
        #  by 28 bytes.
